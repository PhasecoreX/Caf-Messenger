#	CIS 467 Capstone Project - Cafe Messenger
#	CafeAddFriendFrame.py
#	Author: Michael Currie
#	
#	This program is the main GUI frame for the "Add Friend" feature. It will
#	spawn off of CafeChatFrame when the "Add Friend" button is pressed. This
#	GUI will accept a Public RSA Key in order to find another user in the
#	distributed system, and after finding the person it will give their actual
#	name, and the user will be able to set a nickname and a quick note about
#	them.
